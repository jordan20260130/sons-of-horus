# Skitarii

The Skitarii are the cybernetic soldiers of the Adeptus Mechanicus — the "Tech-Guard" who serve as the primary military force of the Cult Mechanicus.

## Overview

Skitarii are genetically modified and heavily cybernetically augmented humans who serve the Tech-Priests without question. They are bred for war, enhanced with bionic implants, and equipped with some of the most advanced weaponry in the Imperium.

Unlike the mass-produced troops of the 41st millennium, Skitarii in the Horus Heresy era (30K) are portrayed as elite relic hunters — the personal forces of the Fabricator General, more "artisan work" than line troops.

## Types of Skitarii

### Skitarii Vanguard

The close-range specialists of the Skitarii legions.

**Equipment:**
- **Radium Carbines** — rapid-fire weapons that emit deadly radiation
- **Plasma Calivers** — high-powered plasma weapons for heavy targets
- **Arc Rifles** — electrical weapons effective against vehicles
- **Transuranic Arquebuses** — long-range armor-piercing rifles (on some models)

**Characteristics:**
- Aggressive, close-range combatants
- Their weapons irradiate both enemy and wielder
- Often equipped with enhanced lungs and rebreather units
- Higher susceptibility to radiation due to their role

### Skitarii Rangers

The long-range scouts and marksmen.

**Equipment:**
- **Galvanic Rifles** — precision weapons with excellent range
- **Transuranic Arquebuses** — heavy sniper rifles for tank hunting
- **Arc Rifles** — anti-vehicle electrical weapons
- **Omnispex** — advanced targeting and scanning equipment

**Characteristics:**
- Patient, methodical hunters
- Excellent at holding objectives from a distance
- Enhanced optics and targeting systems
- Often deployed ahead of main forces as scouts

### Skitarii Alphas

The squad leaders and commanders.

- Enhanced bionics compared to regular troops
- Better armor and weapons
- Lead from the front with enhanced tactical awareness

## Organization

### Skitarii Conclaves (Horus Heresy)

In the Horus Heresy era, Skitarii are organized into specialized conclaves:

- **Battle-Pilgrim Corpus** — Standard Skitarii units (1 Ordinator + 7 Battle Pilgrims)
- **Battle-Pilgrim Marshal** — Character unit leading the conclave
- **Bone-Picker Host** — Zealous warriors equipped with laslocks
- **Vulfrax Stratos Automata** — Flying mechanical support units

### Transport Options

- **Triaros Armored Conveyor** — Transport for Skitarii units
- **Terrax Pattern Termite** — Drilling assault transport
- **Chimerax** — Standard Imperial Guard transport (when allied)

## Weapons & Wargear

### Standard Equipment

| Weapon | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Radium Carbine | Rapid Fire | Irradiates target and wielder |
| Galvanic Rifle | Rapid Fire | Long range, reliable |
| Arc Rifle | Assault | Anti-vehicle electrical damage |
| Plasma Caliver | Assault | High strength, risk of overheating |
| Transuranic Arquebus | Heavy | Sniper rifle, armor-piercing |

### Special Equipment

- **Omnispex** — Ignores cover bonuses for targeting
- **Enhanced Data-Tether** — Improves unit coordination
- **Plasma Phial** — One-use plasma grenade
- **Pater Radium** — Rad-saturation device

## Combat Doctrine

Skitarii excel at:

1. **Combined Arms** — Mixing Vanguard assault with Ranger support fire
2. **Mobile Firepower** — Using transports to position rapidly
3. **Tech-Priest Synergy** — Buffing with Canticles and Dominus abilities
4. **Objective Holding** — Rangers are excellent at camping objectives

They struggle with:

1. **Melee Combat** — Low strength and toughness in close quarters
2. **Survivability** — T3 with 1 wound dies easily
3. **Transport Dependence** — Need vehicles to get where they're going

— Fabricator General Kane, Mars
