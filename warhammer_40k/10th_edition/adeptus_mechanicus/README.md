# Adeptus Mechanicus

The Adeptus Mechanicus is a faction within the Warhammer 40,000 universe, also known as the **Cult Mechanicus** or simply **the Mechanicus**.

## Overview

The Adeptus Mechanicus is the powerful, quasi-religious institution that holds a monopoly on technology throughout the Imperium of Man. They worship the **Omnissiah** (often considered an aspect of the Emperor) and pursue the acquisition of all knowledge and technology in the universe.

### Core Beliefs

- **The Machine God (Omnissiah)** - The supreme deity of technology
- **The Motive Force** - The divine spark that animates all machines
- **The Flesh is Weak** - Biological bodies are inferior to mechanical augmentation

## Lore

The Adeptus Mechanicus predates the Imperium itself, originating on Mars during the Age of Strife. They maintain ancient technologies that even they barely understand, treating technology with religious reverence.

The Mechanicus operates **Forge Worlds** across the galaxy - entire planets dedicated to industrial production and technological research. Each Forge World has its own traditions, specialties, and sometimes heretical beliefs.
