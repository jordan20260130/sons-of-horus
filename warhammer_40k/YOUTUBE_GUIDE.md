## Essential Channels

### Luetin09
**Style:** Deep-dive documentary format
**Best for:** Comprehensive faction histories, Imperium lore, Horus Heresy

Luetin produces long-form (often 1-2 hour) videos that treat 40K lore with serious academic depth. His Horus Heresy series and Adeptus Mechanicus breakdowns are essential viewing for understanding the setting's foundations.

**Start here:**
- Adeptus Mechanicus Lore
- Horus Heresy Complete Series
- Imperium of Man Overview

---

### Baldermort's Guides
**Style:** Quick, funny faction overviews  
**Best for:** "Who are these guys?" introductions, faction comparisons

Short, entertaining guides that explain each faction's deal in 10-15 minutes. Great for deciding which army speaks to you before diving into hours of lore.

**Start here:**
- Faction Guide series (one video per major faction)
- "Why Play..." series

---

### The Templin Institute
**Style:** In-universe documentary  
**Best for:** Immersive lore experience, cinematic storytelling

Presents 40K factions as if they were real organizations being analyzed by historians. High production value and treats the setting with genuine in-universe seriousness.

**Start here:**
- Adeptus Mechanicus dossier
- Any faction "dossier" video

---

### Wolf Lord Rho
**Style:** Audiobook/lore reading  
**Best for:** Primary source material, deep lore, background noise

Reads directly from Black Library novels and codexes. If you want the *actual* written lore without buying books, this is the channel.

**Start here:**
- Codex readings
- Novel excerpts (mechanicus-focused titles)

---

### MajorKill
**Style:** Meme-heavy, comedic  
**Best for:** Catching the *vibe*, entertainment, not taking it too seriously

Australian humor meets 40K lore. Heavy on jokes and memes, but still informative. Good for understanding the community's sense of humor about the setting.

**Start here:**
- "40K Lore in a Nutshell" series
- Faction summary videos

## Adeptus Mechanicus Specific

If you're playing Mechanicus, prioritize these topics:

1. **Forge Worlds** — Different forge worlds have different color schemes and specialties
2. **The Omnissiah** — Understanding their religion makes the faction click
3. **Skitarii Creation** — Vat-grown, augmented, disposable soldiers
4. **The Flesh is Weak** — Why they replace body parts with machines
5. **Horus Heresy Era Mechanicum** — Different from 40K Mechanicus, more independent
